## Hi there 👋

My name is Drew and I am a senior at the University of Minnesota studying Data
Science with a minor in Mathematics. At the University, I am also a student in
the University Honors Program (UHP) which has provided many opportunities
including taking rigorous courses and completing an undergraduate honors thesis.
The thesis will be a culmination of research I will complete towards the end of
my undergraduate career. Currently, I am working with Assistant Professor Aryan
Deshwal on high-dimensional Bayesian optimization, a domain with many real-world
scientific and engineering applications. After finishing my Bachelor's degree, I
plan on pursuing a PhD in computer science with a focus on probabilistic machine
learning, sequential decision-making under uncertainty, Bayesian optimization,
and generative modeling. See my research interests and CV below.

### Research Interests
My research interests include probabilistic machine learning, sequential
decision-making under uncertainty, Bayesian optimization, and generative
modeling. In particular, I am interested in their intersection with respect to
applications in scientific and societal domains such as accelerating discovery
campaigns (i.e., of materials, molecules, medicines, etc.) and engineering
design (i.e., modeling and simulation tuning, principled experimental design,
etc.).

These applications can be formulated as optimization problems with multiple
competing objectives that are black-box, expensive-to-evaluate, and subject to
domain-specific constraints––rendering traditional methods out-of-scope. Even
more challenging, the domains for such applications are often complex:
high-dimensional and composed of mixed-variable or combinatorial inputs, often
with some sort of implicit/underlying structure. Thus, one overarching research
focus of mine to address these ubiquitous challenges is the development of novel
methods for optimizing complex structured input spaces using Bayesian
optimization driven by deep generative models (i.e., guided diffusion).

### Projects
 * [Bayesian Optimization](https://github.com/drewgjerstad/bayesian-optimization)
   (`bayesian-optimization`)  
   _This repository contains my work with Bayesian optimization and related_
   _topics. It consists of notes and tutorials on various topics, interactive_
   _examples, and from-scratch implementations._

 * _More coming soon!_


### Course Projects
 * [Predicting Residential Structure Burn Status Post-Wildfire from Aerial Images](
    https://github.com/drewgjerstad/wildfire-structure-damage-detection)
   (`wildfire-structure-damage-detection`)  
    _This repository contains my group's work to develop machine learning_
    _architecture that can successfully predict the burn status of residential_
    _structures following a wildfire using aerial imagery. This work was_
    _completed as part of the course requirements for CSCI 4521: Applied_
    _Machine Learning at the University of Minnesota in Fall 2025._

 * [Migration in Mozambique](
    https://github.com/drewgjerstad/mozambique-migration-analysis)
   (`mozambique-migration-analysis`)  
    _This repository contains my group's work to analyze census microdata from_
    _Mozambique collected in 1997, 2007, and 2017. Our goal was to classify_
    _respondents as having migrated in the past 1- and 5-year windows using_
    _classification models and association analysis. This work was competed as_
    _part of the course requirements for CSCI 5523: Data Mining at the_
    _University of Minnesota in Fall 2025._
