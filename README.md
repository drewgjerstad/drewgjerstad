## Hi there 👋

My name is Drew and I am a rising senior at the University of Minnesota studying Data Science with a minor in Mathematics. At the University, I am also a student in the University Honors Program (UHP) which has provided many opportunities including taking rigorous courses and completing an undergraduate honors thesis. The thesis will be a culmination of research I will complete towards the end of my undergraduate career. Currently, I am working with Assistant Professor Aryan Deshwal on high-dimensional Bayesian optimization, a domain with many real-world scientific and engineering applications. After finishing my Bachelor's degree, I plan on pursuing a PhD in applied/computational mathematics or computer science.
