## Hi there 👋

> [!NOTE]
> This page is currently under construction. Please stay tuned for updates.

My name is Drew and I am a rising senior at the University of Minnesota studying Data Science with a minor in Mathematics. At the University, I am also a student in the University Honors Program (UHP) which has provided many opportunities including taking more rigorous courses and completing and undergraduate honors thesis. The thesis will be a culmination of research I will complete towards the end of my undergraduate career. Currently, I am working with Assistant Professor Aryan Deshwal on high-dimensional Bayesian optimization, a domain with many real-world scientific and engineering applications. After finishing by Bachelor's degree, I intend on pursuing a PhD in applied/computational mathematics or computer science.
