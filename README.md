## Hi there 👋

My name is Drew and I am a senior at the University of Minnesota studying Data
Science with a minor in Mathematics. At the University, I am also a student in
the University Honors Program (UHP) which has provided many opportunities
including taking rigorous courses and completing an undergraduate honors thesis.
The thesis will be a culmination of research I will complete towards the end of
my undergraduate career. Currently, I am working with Assistant Professor Aryan
Deshwal on high-dimensional Bayesian optimization, a domain with many real-world
scientific and engineering applications. After finishing my Bachelor's degree, I
plan on pursuing a PhD in computer science.

### Languages and Tools
 * **Languages:** Python, MATLAB, R, Julia, C++, SQL, LaTeX
 * **Libraries:** Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch,
   GPyTorch, BoTorch, JuMP
 * **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Weights & Biases, Docker, Tableau, Snowflake,
   PostgreSQL, Microsoft Excel

### Projects
 * [Bayesian Optimization](https://github.com/drewgjerstad/bayesian-optimization)
   (`bayesian-optimization`)  
   _This repository contains my work with Bayesian optimization and related_
   _topics. It consists of notes and tutorials on various topics, interactive_
   _examples, and from-scratch implementations._
 * _More coming soon!_


### Course Projects
 * [Predicting Residential Structure Burn Status Post-Wildfire from Aerial Images](
    https://github.com/drewgjerstad/wildfire-structure-damage-detection)
   (`wildfire-structure-damage-detection`)  
    _This repository contains my group's work to develop machine learning_
    _architecture that can successfully predict the burn status of residential_
    _structures following a wildfire using aerial imagery. This work was_
    _completed as part of the course requirements for CSCI 4521: Applied_
    _Machine Learning at the University of Minnesota in Fall 2025._
 * [Migration in Mozambique](
    https://github.com/drewgjerstad/mozambique-migration-analysis)
   (`mozambique-migration-analysis`)  
    _This repository contains my group's work to analyze census microdata from_
    _Mozambique collected in 1997, 2007, and 2017. Our goal was to classify_
    _respondents as having migrated in the past 1- and 5-year windows using_
    _classification models and association analysis. This work was competed as_
    _part of the course requirements for CSCI 5523: Data Mining at the_
    _University of Minnesota in Fall 2025._
