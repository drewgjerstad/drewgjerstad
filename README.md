## Hi there 👋

My name is Drew and I am a senior at the University of Minnesota studying Data
Science with a minor in Mathematics. At the University, I am also a student in
the University Honors Program (UHP) which has provided many opportunities
including taking rigorous courses and completing an undergraduate honors thesis.
The thesis will be a culmination of research I will complete towards the end of
my undergraduate career. Currently, I am working with Assistant Professor Aryan
Deshwal on high-dimensional Bayesian optimization, a domain with many real-world
scientific and engineering applications. After finishing my Bachelor's degree, I
plan on pursuing a PhD in computer science.

### Languages and Tools
